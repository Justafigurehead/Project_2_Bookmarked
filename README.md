# Project_2_Bookmarked
Second Project, Book Tracker


This is my second project for CodeClan - 16 weeks. It's a minimal application for Android devices that allow users to track the books they are currently reading and update the number of pages. 

In future I had hoped to add the following features:
  - a date picker and dateTime variable type when you are adding a book to the list.
  - enums with String values to set Completed, Currently Reading and Abandoned so I can sort via these tags.
